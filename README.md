This server serves the front end pages and calls the API.

### prerequisites
- NodeJS >= 10.6
- NPM >= 6.10.0


## Getting Started

Node and npm must be installed. The best practice is through a version manager,
nvm for example https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#nvm. In general,
node and npm are bundled together.

1) after node & npm is installed, verify installation by:

```shell
node -v
```
should return a message

```shell
v14.17.6
```
2) next is npm,  verify installation by running:


```shell
npm -v
```
should return a message

```shell
7.22.0
```

3) install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```
4) build js:

```shell
npm run build
```

5) start the server:

```shell
npm start
```

Finally the installed browser will open a new tab which render the first page
in the address http://localhost:5500/
